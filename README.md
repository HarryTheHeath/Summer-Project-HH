**An Island Away** is a 5-week-long project I undertook to create a 3D platformer in UE5.

## Overview

This is a 3D Platforming experience inspired by classic games of the ["Collect-A-Thon"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game#:~:text=format%2C%20and%20the-,%22collect%2Da%2Dthon,-%22%20genre%20began%20to) subgenre, such as Banjo-Kazooie. This namely meant implementing collectible items that trigger bouncy UI triggers and creating a 3D character with several platforming movement abilities that feel satisfying to control.

As I've never developed from scratch in UE5, I saw this assignment as an opportunity to better get to grips with the engine and the blueprint system and decided that it was most important to have mechanics in place than to have much game design beyond a starting demo area. This decision was also made in part due to a planned collaboration falling apart. However, I'm satisfied with the amount of unique features I've been able to develop and the different areas of discipline I've applied myself towards while solo-developing, with a definite clear secondary focus on technical art and animation.
